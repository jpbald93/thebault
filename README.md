# The Sawayama–Thébault theorem in Lean 4

The Sawayama–Thébault theorem: the centres of the two Thébault circles and the incentre are collinear.

This repository is one of eight Lean 4 developments accompanying the paper *Circle configurations in
classical plane geometry, formalized in Lean 4: Clifford's chain, Miquel's five circles, Lester,
Sawayama–Thébault and Kosnita* (J. Bald, 2026). The paper states each theorem in prose with every
hypothesis, lists the degenerate configurations each statement excludes, and reports the verification
summarised below.

**Status:** all statements proved, no `sorry`. `gate.sh` checks **12** named declarations.

## Main statements

| Lean name | File:line | Statement |
|---|---|---|
| `Thebault3.sawayama_thebault` | `Thebault3/Basic.lean:514` | the theorem (circle centres assumed, not constructed) |
| `Thebault3.tri_incenter_spec` | `Thebault3/Basic.lean:470` | Mathlib's incentre is equidistant from the side lines, on the inner side |

Read the Lean statement for the exact hypotheses; the paper lists them in prose.

## Verification

`./gate.sh` builds the library and runs `#print axioms` on the 12 declarations in its `REQUIRED`
list. It fails if a source file contains `sorry`, `admit`, `native_decide`, `axiom`, `#eval`, `run_cmd`,
`set_option`, a macro or syntax extension; if the build fails; or if any listed declaration depends on
anything other than `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

Expected output: `PASS (12 declarations, standard axioms only)`. Checked on x86-64 Linux and arm64
macOS at the pinned Mathlib revision.

`bash tests/tamper.sh` plants defects in scratch copies (ax2line, evalfake, falsehyp, macro, sorry, wrap) and checks that the gate
rejects each one.

The paper also reports a statement-level battery (conclusion mutations, contradiction probe,
satisfiability witnesses, hypothesis ablation, unused-variable linter), an independent numerical
re-check, and a prior-art search. Those results, and their limits, are in the paper's Verification
section.

## Build

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leanprover/elan/master/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh   # if Lean is not installed
lake exe cache get
lake build
./gate.sh
bash tests/tamper.sh
```

Toolchain: Lean `v4.33.1`, Mathlib `v4.33.1` (revision pinned in `lake-manifest.json`). `gate.sh` never
fetches: run `lake exe cache get` first.

## Note on how this was produced

The formal proofs and documentation were developed with the help of a large-language-model AI
assistant. The author directed the work, reviewed the statements, and is responsible for the result.
The Lean kernel checks every proof.
